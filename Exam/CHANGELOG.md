# Change Log

## Changes made during the exam

- Data download for Task 2: 
  - The data download link was updated to the correct one. 
  - The download command was updated to include both `wget` and `curl` because the `wget` command is not installed in Mac OS by default and `curl` is not installed in Ubuntu by default.
- The total points for Task 1 is 44 instead of 50. The total points is 94 + 4(bonus) = 98. 

## Changes made during grading

- Question 3.5:
  - The second sub-question (“Determine if the co-author network is fully connected”) was adjusted to be worth 1 point instead of 2 points to ensure that the total points for the question is 4 points.
