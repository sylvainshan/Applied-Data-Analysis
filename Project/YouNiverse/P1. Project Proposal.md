Analyse weekly time series data (views, subscribers) averaged across all channels to identify common growth trajectories. Investigate whether these patterns represent typical channel behaviour or if they are skewed by outliers. Assess the influence of external events on growth spikes.

Examine titles, tags, descriptions, and upload frequency. Analyse correlations between high subscriber growth and frequent content uploads. Explore whether trends and viral events trigger a snowball effect leading to outlier growth.

Distinguish between gradual declines (stagnant subscriber counts) and abrupt drops. Use time series data, content type, and metadata (e.g., tags, titles) to investigate patterns leading to channel decline. Assess whether internal factors, such as content changes, or external events, contribute to sudden drops in subscribers.

Visualize the network of user interactions (e.g., comments) around popular channels. Use centrality and density metrics to assess whether highly subscribed channels hold central roles in the comment network.

Construct a temporal network of user comments linked to videos and creators, tracking the development of communities on a monthly basis. Analyse how these communities grow, merge, or dissolve over time, using content topic trends and creator interactions.

Define engagement levels per community based on metrics such as comments, likes, and views. Analyse whether high-engagement communities exhibit stronger internal interactions (e.g., comment threads) and external interactions (e.g., cross-commenting on other communities).
